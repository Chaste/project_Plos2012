\subject{Re. Submission of Software Article to PLoS Computational Biology}  

\opening{Dear Editors,}

Please find attached our submission of a PLoS Computational Biology Software Article {\bf ``Chaste: an open source C++ library for computational physiology and biology''}.
This is in response to the invitation of Andreas Prlic (Software Editor), 
following our pre-submission inquiry (manuscript number, \textbf{PCOMPBIOL-D-12-00340}).

We have described the additional capabilities of our `Chaste' v3.1 software (released on 9th August 2012), discussing improvements since previous articles on Chaste v1.0 (from 2009).
In order to communicate effectively the role the Chaste could play in simulation studies for the readership, we took the decision to create simple example simulations. 
These simulations are representative of Chaste's capabilities, may be easily understood, and can be run in their entirety on a desktop computer overnight.
Such examples are necessarily simplifications of our scientific studies (many of which require High Performance Computing resources).
There is much discussion in the article of the scientific insight large-scale Chaste simulations have generated, and corresponding citations to peer-reviewed literature.

The article has an associated Chaste `project', which is attached to the submission in zipped format. 
This project works with Chaste v3.1, available to download from our website \url{http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/download.html}. 
Our website also hosts a dedicated wiki page for this article, which leads the reader, in a tutorial format, through the codes used to generate the example figures and supplementary material movies. 
This can be found at \url{https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/PaperTutorials/Plos2012}, as discussed in the supplementary material. 
The supplementary material also provides links to guides for the installation of the Chaste software, along with dependencies and their licence requirements.

We hope that you will find the article a valuable addition to PLoS Computational Biology. 
Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.

Yours sincerely,
